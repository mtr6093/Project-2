# Multiple Shopping List Application


The link below will open a web page to either create a user or log in as an existing user.

https://marc-project2-lists.herokuapp.com/

As a user you can create, edit, and delete items from two different shopping lists. You can also see what items were entered by yourself on your profile page and see who entered each item on the shopping list by clicking on the item and viewing the item details.


## Current Features

Below is a list of users stories that were followed to create the existing functionality.

1. As a new user I want to be able to create an account to be able to use the application

2. As an existing user I want to be able to login into my account to use the application

3. As an existing user I want to be able to edit information in my account

4. As a user I want to be able to delete my account

5. As a user I want to use multiple shopping lists based on type of shopping needed (i.e. a parts shopping list or a grocery shopping list)

6. As a user I want the shopping lists to tell me what users entered the items into the list

7. As a user I want to be able to create new entries into lists

8. As a user I want to be able to edit items in a list

9. As a user I want to be able to delete items from a list

10. As a user I want to be able to select which list I want to look at

11. As a user I want the grocery list sorted by sections of the store (i.e. all meat items listed together)

## Known Issues

Due to implementation of secure login and password storage, editing the password will break the ability to login to a users profile.

## Future Development

In addition to fixing the known issues, the user stories below are for future development:

1. Create new/additional shopping lists

2. Allow users to see only certain lists available on their profile page

3. Provide a drop dwon selection for store sections on the grocery list to reduce confusion

4. Allow users to input sections of the store in the grocery list for selection in the drop down

5. Provide a link back to the profile page from the list views after a user is loged in
